# 🌌 Monad Quantum Yield Migrator

## 🚀 Overview

Monad Quantum Yield Migrator is the **ultimate on-chain automation experience** that uses MetaMask Smart Accounts and Delegation to automatically optimize yields across multiple chains. Our gas-aware system calculates net APY after all costs and executes migrations when profitable opportunities are detected.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**🌐 Experience the Quantum Interface:**

### ✅ **Monad Testnet Deployment**
- Contract optimized for Monad's high throughput
- Deployed on Monad testnet
- Uses Monad as coordination layer

### ✅ **Cross-Chain Integration**
- **Monad + Base + Arbitrum** multi-chain support
- Cross-chain yield monitoring
- Gas-aware migration decisions

### ✅ **Envio Integration**
- Real-time cross-chain monitoring
- Yield opportunity detection
- Performance analytics dashboard

✅ Current State:
Base: 4.1% APY (lower yield)

Monad: 8.1% APY (higher yield - BEST)

Arbitrum: 5.2% APY (medium yield)

✅ What's Happening:
The system detected that Monad has the highest yield (8.1%) and is automatically migrating funds from Base → Monad to capture the +3.6% APY gain.

✅ The Math:

Monad APY (8.1%) - Base APY (4.1%) = 4.0% Gross Gain
Minus Gas Costs = 3.6% Net Gain ✅


✅ MetaMask Smart Accounts & Delegation
Your Smart Account is connected

Delegation permissions are active

Agent is automatically executing migrations

✅ Cross-Chain Automation
Monitoring 3 chains simultaneously

Detecting yield opportunities

Executing cross-chain migrations

✅ Gas-Aware Optimization
Showing NET APY after gas costs

Calculating profitable migrations

Only executing when net gain > threshold

✅ Envio Integration
Real-time yield monitoring

Multi-chain data aggregation

Performance tracking

⚡ What Happens Next:
The yields will update every 3 seconds (live simulation)

More migration transactions will appear in the log

The system will continuously optimize across all 3 chains
